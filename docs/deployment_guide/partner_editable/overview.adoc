This Quick Start reference deployment guide provides step-by-step instructions for
deploying https://www.hashicorp.com/products/consul[{partner-product-name}] on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud. http://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/[Quick Starts] are
automated reference deployments that use AWS CloudFormation templates to launch,
configure, and run the AWS compute, network, storage, and other services required to
deploy a specific workload on AWS.
{partner-product-name} is a tool that provides a foundation for cloud networking automation by
using a central registry for service-based networking. {partner-product-name}'s core use cases include the
following:

* Service registry and health monitoring, to provide a real-time directory of all services
with their health status

* Network middleware automation, with service discovery for dynamic reconfiguration as
services scale up, scale down, or move

* Zero Trust network with service mesh, to secure service-to-service traffic with identitybased security policies and encrypted traffic with Mutual-Transport Layer Security
(TLS)

{partner-product-name} is designed to be friendly to both the DevOps community and application
developers, making it a good fit for modern, elastic infrastructures.
This Quick Start is for users who are looking for a solution for service discovery,
monitoring, or a key/value store. The Quick Start is built using the open-source version of
{partner-product-name}, but is also compatible with {partner-product-name} Enterprise.
An expanded version of this deployment guide with detailed instructions and screen
illustrations is available on the https://www.consul.io/docs/index.html[{partner-product-name}] and https://www.hashicorp.com/consul.html[{partner-product-name} Enterprise] websites.
