image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Partner Solution sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans three Availability Zones.
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
** A Linux bastion host in an Auto Scaling group to allow inbound Secure Shell (SSH) access to EC2 instances in public and private subnets.*
* A Classic Load Balancer to distribute traffic among Consul client nodes in the private subnets.
* In the private subnets:
** Consul client nodes deployed to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances in an Auto Scaling group.
** Consul server nodes deployed to Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group. You can choose to deploy 3, 5, or 7 server nodes (3 shown).
** Consul template installed to client and server nodes to integrate applications with the Consul service catalog and key/value store (not shown).
** Dnsmasq installed to client and server nodes to integrate applications with the Consul Domain Name System (DNS) interface for service discovery (not shown).
** Amazon Certificate Manager (ACM) to create or import a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate to associate with the Classic Load Balancer.
