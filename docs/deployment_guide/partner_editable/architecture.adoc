.Quick Start architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans three Availability Zones.*

* A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*

In the public subnets:

* Linux bastion hosts to allow inbound Secure Shell (SSH) access to EC2 instances in the private subnets.*

* Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.*

* A Classic Load Balancer with AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) attached to the {partner-product-name} server cluster Auto Scaling group. You can choose to add your own Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate to it. 

In the private subnets:

* An Auto Scaling group for {partner-product-name} clients. The number of clients is set to 0 by default,
but is user-configurable.

* An Auto Scaling group for a {partner-product-name} server cluster in the private subnets. You can choose to create 3, 5, or 7 servers.

* {partner-product-name} Template (the {partner-product-name}-template daemon) installed on all nodes for integrating applications with {partner-product-name}'s service catalog and key/value store.

* *Dnsmasq* installed on all nodes for integrating applications with {partner-product-name}'s Domain Name System (DNS) interface for service discovery
