// There are generally two deployment options. If additional are required, add them here

This Quick Start provides two deployment options:

* *Deploy {partner-product-name} into a new VPC (end-to-end deployment)*. This option builds builds a new VPC with public and private subnets, and then deploys {partner-product-name} into this new VPC.
* *Deploy {partner-product-name} into an existing VPC*. This option provisions {partner-product-name} in your existing AWS infrastructure.

The Quick Start provides separate templates for these options. It also lets you configure Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks, instance types, and {partner-product-name} settings, as discussed later in this guide.
