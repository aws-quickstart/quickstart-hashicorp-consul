==== Prepare your AWS account

1. If you donâ€™t already have an AWS account, create one at http://aws.amazon.com by
following the on-screen instructions.

2. Use the region selector in the navigation bar to choose the AWS Region where you want
to deploy HashiCorp Consul on AWS.

3. Create a http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html[key pair] in your preferred region.

4. If necessary, request a https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home?region=us-east-1#!/[service quota increase] for the Amazon EC2 t2.medium instance
type. You might need to do this if you already have an existing deployment that uses this
instance type, and you think you might exceed the http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-resource-limits.html[default quota] with this reference
deployment.
